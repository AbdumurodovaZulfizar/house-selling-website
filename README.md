# house-selling-website

This project has 2 pages, namely: home page and search page. It is completely responsive and targets 2 breakpoints. This project also utilizes utility classes heavily such as `mt-3`, `flex`, instead of specific classes like `navigation`, `accordion` etc, for their reusability purposes.

All the `.css` file has been segmentized into directories depending on their `action`. For example: `pink` and `pink-background` classes go inside the `colors` directory and more generic classes such as the `gotham` go inside the `Fonts` directory. The componentization method has been adopted to avoid specificity issues and for ease of `import`ing the files.
